# cpp_lectures
Lectures on C++ for year one international computer science students progressing to university.

The lectures are organized as interactive notebooks which students can open and read the notes but also try out the exercises directly in the notebook itself. Every notebook starts with the chapters within the module textbooks to refer to for further details and ends with further reading and exercises to try. It is highly recommended that students refer to the textbooks, these notes and exercises regularly and discuss with their tutor in class.

# Module Texts
1. C Programming: Absolute Beginners Guide (Cycle 1)
2. C++17: From Novice to Professional (Cycle 2)
