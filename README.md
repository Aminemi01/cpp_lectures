# cpp_lectures
Lecture notes on C++ for year one international computer science students progressing to university.

The lectures are organized as folders containing the notes and code examples. The students can open and read the notes but also try out the exercises by typing out their solutions in `main.cpp`. Each notes starts with the chapters within the module textbooks to refer to for further details and ends with further reading and exercises to try.
